Iâ€™m titling this post the same as the name of my site because I am unoriginal, but also because this post is mostly about the goals for my blog.

Over the past couple years I have worked in infrastructure, mostly around container orchestration and deployment. As such, my opinions on the subject have escalated from half baked rants in the shower into ideas and experiences others may be interested in. My hope with this blog is to figure out how to articulate these ideas into a coherent format for consumption. If as a byproduct I manage to personally grow in terms of researching and improving my writing skills, I will be ecstatic.

Finally, I consider myself to be horrible at grammar and writing and for that I apologize ahead of time. Who knows the frequency in which I post, but generally I hope that all posts, unlike this one will have substance and will not be just to post my first blog post.

All of the opinions in my posts are my own and not that of the company that I am currently employed.
