My name is **_Eric Larssen_** and I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Workiva Inc.][1] where I help
build and maintain the Infrastructure platform our organization runs on. Every day I am challenged
with new and interesting problems spending a great deal of time working with third party Kubernetes
services trying to either get them working in our organizations ecosystem or determining if they
are worth running at all. When I am not at work I love to spend time with my family. Besides that,
my main interests include following Formula 1, collecting and sometimes drinking craft beer, and
the occasional video game.
